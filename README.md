<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a project that was proposed by Dr. Amar Basu, a faculty advisor for Electrical and Biomedical Engineering department of Wayne State University. The objetive of this project was to develop a cross platform app that will be used to perform at-home medical diagnostics with the TRACE wearable biosensor. 

More information about the TRACE wearable biosensor can be found at: https://microfluidics.wayne.edu/index.html

### Built With

In order to ensure that this application runs on both Android and iOS, it was built upon React Native and the following libraries:
* [React Native v.0.63.3 ](https://reactnative.dev/)
* [React Native BLE PLX v.2.0.2](https://github.com/Polidea/react-native-ble-plx)
* [Redux v.4.0.5](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started)
* [Plotly JS](https://plotly.com/javascript/)
