<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a project that was proposed by Dr. Amar Basu, a faculty advisor for Electrical and Biomedical Engineering department of Wayne State University. The objetive of this project was to develop a cross platform app that will be used to perform at-home medical diagnostics with the TRACE wearable biosensor. 

More information about the TRACE wearable biosensor can be found at: https://microfluidics.wayne.edu/index.html


### Built With

In order to ensure that this application runs on both Android and iOS, it was built upon React Native and the following libraries:
* [React Native v.0.63.3 ](https://reactnative.dev/)
* [React Native BLE PLX v.2.0.2](https://github.com/Polidea/react-native-ble-plx)
* [Redux v.4.0.5](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started)
* [Plotly JS](https://plotly.com/javascript/)

<!-- FEATURES -->




<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get started, follow the instructions below which detail the necessary stack required to run the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

This project is built on top of the React Native framework. 
* React Native - https://reactnative.dev/

To set up the React Native developement environment, please follow the instructions on the official React Native website at the link below:

Setting up the development environment -----> https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/askandlearn/traceapp-wsu
   ```
2. Install the NPM packages after navigating to the project directory
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
### Running on Android
1. In a terminal, make sure the directory matches the full path to the root of the project, then start the metro bundler using the following command
   ```sh
   npx react-native start
    ```
2. Open another terminal to your root project directory and launch the Android emulator
   ```sh
    npx react-native run-android
   ```
3. The project will begin to build. This may take serval minutes.

* If any build errors occur regarding gradle, open a new terminal to the root directory and navigate to the Android folder within the project by doing the following
    ```sh
     cd android
    ```
Next, run the command below
    ```sh
    gradlew clean
    ```

### Running on iOS
1. In a terminal, make sure the directory matches the full path to the root of the project, then start the metro bundler using the following command
   ```sh
   npm react-native start
    ```
2. Open another terminal to your root project directory and launch the iOS emulator
   ```sh
    npm react-native run-ios
   ```
3. The project will begin to build. This may take serval minutes.

* If any build errors occur, open a new terminal to the root directory and navigate to the iOS folder within the project by doing the following
    ```sh
     cd ios
    ```
Next, run the command below
    ```sh
    pod install
    ```
<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The TRACE app has three distinct features that allow users to interact with the TRACE biosensor. 

1. Active Stand Up Test
2. Heart-Rate Variability
3. Real-Time Data
